# Task-Two---Algorithm-
•	Connect Beacon chip to data base.

•	Attach Beacon chip to visitors’ pass.

•	Always record the location of all visitors .

•	Limit the number of visitors as shown below.

•	Collect data from the Beacon chip.

•	If the visitors are 1-meter apar Then do nothing.

•	If the visitors are too close to each other send a warning to data base and the inform the visitors through their mobile phones.

•	Collect data on where the visitors get too close.

•	Analyze the data from the first day and re arrange the gallery accordingly.

Applying Social Distancing: 

Firstly, we get the area of the hall itself and then divide the area to segments, as if each visitor will get a certain area ( 1m2 ), thus limiting the number of visitors at the same time to the number “X” which insure that visitors will be at least 1 meter apart. 
For example, if the hall is 40 m2  the maximum number of visitors is 40 if we want to keep them 1 meter of each other. However, this will limit the area in which they can move, and the solution for that is to decrease the number of visitors. The smaller number of visitors you have the more space there is for each visitor to move  but the over all number will be small. Or you can have more visitors – 40 max – but their movement will be restricted. I advise that you decrease the number of visitors by 5 – 7 than the maximum number so they will have a fair space to move in.
